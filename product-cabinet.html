    <!-- STORYTELLING -->
    <section class="storytelling">
      <h2>Your Mind, Your Space</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy, Cabinet of Selves embraces the idea that we are not one voice—but many. IFS views the mind as a system of parts, each holding beliefs, roles, or wounds. By engaging these parts compassionately, we create harmony and internal leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the app, you’ll see all your parts arranged with intention. Add visuals, describe their thoughts, reflect on what they need. Whether you’re working with protectors or exiles, you can offer them space and attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not just a tool—it’s a philosophy. One that trusts you to be your own healer, listener, and leader. That’s why there are no trackers, no accounts, no subscriptions—just a one-time purchase and full access, forever.
