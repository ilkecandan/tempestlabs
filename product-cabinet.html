    <p data-key="cabinet.howitworks.desc">
      Cabinet of Selves gives you a sanctuary of stillness and depth. With an elegant interface designed to feel soft, intuitive, and warm, you can explore and organize the voices within you. Add new parts, track their emotional states, journal their messages, and return to them whenever you need. It’s a living map of your inner landscape.

  <section class="storytelling">
    <h2 data-key="cabinet.story.title">Your Mind, Your Space</h2>
    <p data-key="cabinet.story.ifs">
      Inspired by Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy, Cabinet of Selves embraces the idea that we are not one voice—but many. IFS views the mind as a system of parts, each holding beliefs, roles, or wounds. By engaging these parts compassionately, we create harmony and internal leadership. If you're new to this, we recommend the book <em>No Bad Parts: Healing Trauma and Restoring Wholeness with the Internal Family Systems Model</em> by Richard Schwartz, Ph.D.—the founder of the IFS model.
    </p>
    <p data-key="cabinet.story.experience">
      Inside the app, you’ll see all your parts arranged with intention. Add visuals, describe their thoughts, reflect on what they need. Whether you’re working with protectors or exiles, you can offer them space and attention.
    </p>
    <p data-key="cabinet.story.trust">
      This is not just a tool—it’s a philosophy. One that trusts you to be your own healer, listener, and leader. One that respects your boundaries. That’s why there are no trackers, no accounts, no subscriptions—just a one-time purchase and full access, forever.
